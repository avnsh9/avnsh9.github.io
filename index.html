                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p style="padding: 50px;">Are we alone? This is the age-old question that human civilization has been
                    asking since
                    time immemorial. In today's era, this question has evolved and now we ask if there are
                    other planets with life-supporting conditions, and one of the most crucial part of this is the
                    planetâ€™s atmosphere. To date, more than 5500 exoplanets have been discovered and this
                    number is increasing each day. Detection of an exoplanet is just the beginning of profiling
                    and characterization of its atmosphere. Planets having an atmosphere impart this informa
                    tion as a unique fingerprint on the starlight, that pass through it during transit. Different
                    techniques are applied to extract this information from the observed spectra of an exo
                    planet. Interpretation of these observed spectra requires planetary atmosphere models
                    that can realistically simulate the atmospheric conditions and therefore provide con-
                    straints on the chemical compositions, pressure-temperature (P-T) profiles, energy trans
                    port, habitability, etc. in exoplanetary atmospheres. I present the development of SANSAR (Suite of
                    Adaptable plaNetary atmoSphere model And Retrieval), an adaptable planetary atmosphere model
                    designed to simulate various exoplanet types, including Earth-like and super-Earth terrestrial
                    exoplanets, warm Neptunes, hot Jupiters, and other gas giants. I have specifically developed the
                    transmission spectra component of this suite, which plays a crucial role in characterizing exoplanet
                    atmospheres. Additionally, I have created an extensive opacity database that spans a wide range of
                    temperatures (70 - 3000 K) and pressures ($7 \times 10^{-10}$ to 1000 bar), ensuring that SANSAR can
                    accurately model diverse atmospheric conditions.</p>

            <h3 style="margin: 50px; color: red;">But what is Transit Depth?</h3>
            <div id="VideoForTransit" class="FigureExplainSBS">
                <article>
                    <div class="definition">When a planetary body transits its host star along the observer's line
                        of
                        sight, it blocks a
                        portion of the stellar radiation, producing a transmission spectrum.

                        Transit depth is given by
                        \begin{equation}
                        \delta_\lambda = \frac{F_{out,\lambda} - F_{in,\lambda}}{F_{out,\lambda}}
                        \label{eq:transit depth}
                        \end{equation}
                        Here, $F_{\lambda}$ represents the intensity integrated over the solid angle subtended by
                        the
                        star as seen by the observer. Subscript 'out' and 'in' represent the flux before and during
                        the
                        transit respectively. This transit depth is given in terms of Planetary radius as,
                        \begin{equation}
                        \delta_\lambda =
                        \frac{R_p^2}{R_\star^2}
                        \label{eq:rprstar}
                        \end{equation} </div>



                    <p class="proof">In a plane parallel assumption,

                        Neglecting planetary emissions and considering steller brightness to be uniform along the
                        whole
                        steller region.
                        \begin{equation}
                        F_{out,\lambda} = \frac{I_{\lambda}A_{out}}{D^2}\\
                        F_{in,\lambda} = \frac{ I_{\lambda}A_{in}}{D^2}

                        \end{equation}
                        Where $A_{out(in)}$ is the area projected by the source before(during) transition onto the
                        observer.


                        \begin{align*}
                        \delta_\lambda = \frac{A_{out} - A_{in}}{A_{out}}
                        \end{align*}
                        We know that
                        \begin{align*}
                        A_{out} = \pi R_{\star}^2 (\text{Area of steller disk}), \\
                        A_{in} = \pi R_{\star}^2 - \pi R_{p}^2 (\text{Planetary disk area})
                        \end{align*}

                        Thus,
                        \begin{equation}
                        \delta_\lambda = \frac{\pi R_\star^2 - (\pi R_\star^2- \pi R_p^2)}{\pi R_\star^2} =
                        \frac{R_p^2}{R_\star^2}
                        \end{equation}

                        Thus $R_p$ is a wavelength dependent radius of the planet</p>


                    Taking absorption into consideration,

                    \begin{equation}
                    \delta = \frac{R_{low}^2 + 2\int_{R_{low}}^{R_{low}+H_{atm}} b (1-e^{-\tau(b)})db}{R_\star^2}
                    \label{eq:td main}
                    \end{equation}
                    Here $R_{low}^2$ is the lowest radius below which no radiation can pass the atmosphere,
                    $H_{atm}$ is the total height of the atmosphere and 'b' is the impact parameter of the ray
                    passing through the atmosphere.
                    This equation is a mathematical representation of addition of cross section area of each layer
                    weighted by the amount of radiation they block.
                    $\tau$ (or optical depth) in above equation is a characteristic of molecules and the atmospheric
                    structure.

                <p>Reinterpretation of the results published by experimental collaborations is
                    vital for theorists to check their own BSM model against the published data.
                    Often, background model used in an analysis has large number of parameters
                    to model the uncertainties. To test the applicability of an analysis to a new
                    BSM model requires dedicated reinterpretation (CheckMATE is one such tool).
                    This means only a few signal hypothesis can be tested, given the limitation on
                    computational resources. To overcome this, the idea of simplified likelihood was
                    proposed.
                    Simplified likelihood uses a reduced set of parameters to model the background
                    contributions. It makes reinterpretation of the CMS experiments relatively easy.
                    In this thesis, a procedure for constructing the simplified likelihood has been
                    presented. Validation of this procedure has been done using toy data provided
                    by the CMS. We also implemented a CMS search for dark matter and shows
